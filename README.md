### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future. 

Here's what I worked on this past week...

**Week 1**: This week I have worked on a variety of tasks from making a C# project, Creating a GitHub student account, Learning Terminal Commands to better use GitHub, and using Markdown syntax. Though I found using Terminal challenging Iâ€™m excited to get more familiar with it and see what follows in the weeks to come. 

**Week 2**:    

**Week 3**:    

**Week 4**:
