### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future. 

Here's what I worked on this past week...

**Week 1**: This week I have worked on a variety of tasks from making a C# project, Creating a GitHub student account, Learning Terminal Commands to better use GitHub, and using Markdown syntax. Though I found using Terminal challenging Iâ€™m excited to get more familiar with it and see what follows in the weeks to come. 

**Week 2**:    
This week was quite busy as we touch on multiple topics including OOP, UML. We also continued upon last weeks topics of Markup syntax, maintaining, managing and iterate code within a repositiory by adding new elements to the projects we are working on and Updating them with new feedback acquired throughout the week. Along with that, we also learned more indepth about UML and how it is utilized in planning enviroments in todays industrys.  

**Week 3**:    
This week I worked on continuing the project milestone while adding File I/O to my project. Along with working on File I/O integration to my project I was also able to learn new concepts such as the deconstruction process which turns out is somthing that I already do when I'm trying to figure out why something isnt working or when I forget what I'm doing. 

**Week 4**:
