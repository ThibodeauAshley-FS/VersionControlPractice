This paper addresses some of the topic matter covered in research and activity this week. Be sure to include reference links below to the research and information you used to complete this assignment.

## Topic: Activity Diagrams
Professional developers have the ability to understand simple UML sketch diagrams. It's essential to understand some of the fundamental symbols to communicate well with others. 

Update the information below to demonstrate your knowledge on this topic.   

**1. Common Symbols.**

Describe what each UML symbol outlined below is used for in an Activity Diagram. 

**The last bullet provides an example**.

* Diamond: Decision 
* Solid Circle: Start 
* Solid Line and Arrow: Transition flow
* Dotted Line and Text connecting to a Diamond: Decision input
* Rectangle: Process
* Solid Circle surrounded by another Circle: End
* A symbol called "Fork":  support concurrent activities
* **A symbol called "Join"**: A join is a solid line that denotes where two possible steps in a program flow resolve to the same next step. 


**2. Linear vs Non-Linear**

What is the difference between a linear and non-linear process? 

A linear process is a sequence of events that must happen in order. A nonlinear process is a series of actions and decisions that can occur in any order.


## Topic: Class Diagrams
UML can also be used to create class diagrams. Respond below to show your understanding of this topic.   

**1. List at least three symbols that denote Accessibility (aka Visibility) in a Class Diagram.**

 * [ + ] Public - visible globally
 * [ - ] Private - not visible outside the owning type
 * [ # ] Protected - visible to types derived from the owner
 * [ ~ ] Package - visible to other types within the same package.



**2. What does the term "Attributes" mean in a Class Diagram? Provide one or more examples.**

An attribute defines values that can be attached to instances of the class or interface.   

**3. What does the term "Behaviors" mean in a Class Diagram? Provide one or more examples.**

"Behaviors" or operations in a Class Diagram characterize the what the objects can do. Such as return a value.

**4. What is the benefit of defining a minimum set of requirements at the beginning of a project? Also explain the what the term "minimum viable product" means in development.**  

A minimum viable product is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. The benefit of defining a minimum set of requirements at the beginning of the project gives the developer a basline for the minimum viable product goal that they can work off of.

# Reference Links
Replace the example references below with your own links and recommended resources. It is acceptable to provide multiple links for a single topic and to use material provided to you in this class. You are encouraged to link to your own independent research as well. 

The most helpful of the resources I found this week was the class diagram reference 1 because it goes into detail with examples of building class diagrams. As someone who has made them but isnâ€™t exactly confident that I could build one off the top of my head. I found this to be a very help guide.
